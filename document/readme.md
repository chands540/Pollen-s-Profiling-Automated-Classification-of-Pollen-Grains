##  Project Summary:

**Title:**
**Pollen’s Profiling: Automated Classification of Pollen Grains**

**Goal:**
To build a deep learning system using **CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)** that can **automatically classify microscopic images of pollen grains** based on their shape, size, and texture.

---

##  Key Features:

* ✅ Built with **Python**, **TensorFlow/Keras**, and deployed via a **Flask web app**.
* ✅ Users can upload pollen grain images and get instant predictions in the browser.
* ✅ Uses a CNN model trained on categorized image data and saved as `model.h5` or `cnn.hdf5`.

---

##  Use Cases:

* **Environmental Research:** Track pollen diversity and distribution.
* **Healthcare:** Help diagnose allergies caused by specific pollen types.
* **Agriculture:** Monitor pollination efficiency for crop yield.

---

##  Tech Stack:

* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Backend:** Flask (Python)
* **Model:** CNN trained with image data and image augmentation
* **Output:** Predicted pollen class with accuracy

---

## Testing & Results:

* Model accurately classifies clear and rare pollen images.
* Web app is responsive on mobile.
* Prediction time: under 3 seconds (minor delay for bulk inputs).
* Fully working prototype deployed locally.

---

##  Outcome:

A user-friendly, browser-based tool that **reduces manual effort** in pollen classification and can support **scientific research, diagnostics, and crop science**.
